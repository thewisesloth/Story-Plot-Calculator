# Story-Plot-Calculator
The Story Plot Calculator is a program that streamlines the process of writing stories by breaking them down into scenes and allowing you to insert premade and/or custom plot points which tell you what needs to happen in each scene. The plot points are based on psychology, established industry standards, and logical cause and effect relationships.
