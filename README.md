# Story-Plot-Calculator
The Story Plot Calculator is a program that streamlines the process of writing stories by breaking them down into scenes and allowing you to insert premade and/or custom plot points into each scene, which tell you what needs to happen in each scene. The plot points are based on psychology, established industry standards, and logical cause and effect relationships.
