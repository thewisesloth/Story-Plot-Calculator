# Story-Plot-Calculator
The Story Plot Calculator is a program that streamlines the process of writing stories by breaking them down into scenes and allowing you to insert premade and/or custom plot points which tell you what needs to happen in each scene. The plot points are based on psychology, established industry standards, and logical cause and effect relationships. 

I'm putting this information on Github because I want everyone to be able to have access to the highest quality story plotting/writing software possible, and I want this software to be able to be used for different purposes. You can use story plotting logic to write fiction for entertainment, psychological self-help planning, project management, artificial intelligence, and other applications I couldn't dream of. This software belongs in the public domain so it can have the greatest impact on society. 

I don't know how to code at all, and I don't understand Github's functions very well. So I'm totally unqualified to manage the pull requests and all that stuff. If you want to work on this project, I encourage you to download my documents and create your own Github project with it. If you put it on Github to share with the world, I will gladly consult with you and offer any help I can short of coding. Of course, if you want to make your own version and sell it for a profit, you have the legal right to do so without giving me any compensation. The only catch is, you can’t sue anyone else for copyright infringement if they make a similar program using the intellectual property that I’ve released to the public domain. 

In this repository, you'll find 7 documents. Below is a description of each document and an explanation of why they're here:

1. The Wise Sloth Plot Calculator Design Manual

This Word document shows and explains how the program looks and operates. 

2. 241 Plot Points - Starring The Hero

This Word document contains 241 plot points that constitute a complete story and provide options for different paths the story can take. They are organized into different categories, which correspond the folders they will be nested in in the program. You can also print them out and organize them physically. These plot points are labeled as belonging to "THE HERO." 

3. 241 Plot Points - Starring The Antagonist

This Word document contains 241 plot points that constitute a complete story and provide options for different paths the story can take. They are organized into different categories, which correspond the folders they will be nested in in the program. You can also print them out and organize them physically. These plot points are labeled as belonging to "THE ANTAGONIST." 

4. 241 Plot Points - Starring The Character

This Word document contains 241 plot points that constitute a complete story and provide options for different paths the story can take. They are organized into different categories, which correspond the folders they will be nested in in the program. You can also print them out and organize them physically. These plot points are labeled as belonging to "THE CHARACTER." 

5. Blank Sequence Templates

This Excel spreadsheet demonstrates shows blank story templates from a bird's eye view of blank story outlines with 25, 40, 90, and 120 scenes with examples of how the scenes can be divided into sequences. It also includes a few other pages showing how plot points can branch into multiple sub-options. This document is incomplete and is only intended to help the viewer visualize a work space where they can plot stories. If you want, you can use this as a blank canvas to plot stories in without the use of the plot calculator program. 

6. Plot Points Arranged Into Sequences

This Excel spreadsheet shows some brief examples of how you can combine plot points to create narrative sequences such as inciting incidents and missions. It is incomplete and is only intended to help the viewer visualize who they can combine plot points to create sequences. 

7. 14 Movie Breakdowns

This Excel spreadsheet is not a part of the plot program. It is a beat-by-beat breakdown of 14 famous movies that is intended to help the viewer visualize movie structure. It also includes a detailed breakdown of the relationships between the characters in those movies. When the plot program is complete, I will use this document to help make templates that include plot points assigned to each scene.
